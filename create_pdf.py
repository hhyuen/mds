"""
create_pdf.py

Builds a single captioned PDF from screenshots in the screenshots/ folder,
in a hardcoded custom order, WITHOUT losing image quality.

Key fix vs previous versions:
  - Captions are burned onto each PNG using PIL (lossless pixel operations),
    adding a plain white strip above the original screenshot and drawing
    text on that strip only. The chart/screenshot pixels themselves are
    never touched, resampled, or recompressed.
  - The captioned PNGs are then assembled into a PDF using img2pdf, which
    embeds images byte-for-byte with NO re-encoding (unlike ReportLab's
    drawImage, which JPEG-compresses images by default and blurs fine
    chart text/candlesticks).

Edit ORDERED_IMAGES to control:
  - which images are included
  - what order they appear in the PDF
  - what caption is printed above each image
